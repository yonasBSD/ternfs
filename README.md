A distributed file system. For a high-level description of TernFS, see [the TernFS blog post on the XTX Markets Tech Blog](https://xtxmarkets.com/tech/2025-ternfs). This document provides a more bare-bones overview and an introduction to the codebase.

## Goals

The target use case for TernFS is the kind of machine learning we do at XTX: reading and writing large immutable files. By "immutable" we mean files that do not need modifying after they are first created. By "large" we mean that most of the storage space will be taken up by files bigger than a few MBs.

We don't expect new directories to be created often, and files (or directories) to be moved between directories often. In terms of numbers, we expect the upper bound for TernFS to roughly be the upper bound for the data we're planning for a single data center:

- 10EB of logical file storage (i.e. if you sum all file sizes = 10EB)
- 1 trillion files -- average ~10MB file size
- 100 billion directories -- average ~10 files per directory
- 1 million clients

We want to drive the filesystem with commodity hardware and Ethernet networking.

We want the system to be robust in various ways:

* Witnessing half-written files should be impossible -- a file is fully written by the writer or not readable by other clients
* Power loss or similar failure of storage or metadata nodes should not result in a corrupted filesystem (be it metadata or filesystem corruption)
* Corrupted reads due to hard drives bitrot should be exceedingly unlikely
* Data loss should be exceedingly unlikely, unless we suffer a datacenter-wide catastrophic event (fire, flooding, datacenter-wide vibration, etc.)
* The filesystem should keep working through maintenance or failure of metadata or storage nodes

We also want to be able to restore deleted files or directories, using a configurable "permanent deletion" policy.

Finally, we want to have the option to replicate TernFS to multiple regions, to be able to scale up compute across multiple data centres, and to remove any single data centre as a point of failure.

## Building

```
% ./build.sh alpine
```

Will build all the artifacts apart from the Kernel module. The output binaries will be in `build/alpine`. Things will be built in an Alpine Linux container, so that everything will be fully statically linked.

There's also `./build.sh ubuntu` which will do the same but in a Ubuntu container, and `./build.sh release` which will build outside docker, which means that you'll have to install some dependencies in the host machine. Both of these build options will have glibc as the only dynamically linked dependency.

We use the Ubuntu-built version in production, mostly due to jemalloc not playing well with Alpine. It should be easy to produce a performant Alpine build, we just never had the need so far.

## Testing

```
./ci.py --build --integration --short --docker
```

Will run the integration tests as CI would (inside the Ubuntu docker image). You can also run the tests outside docker by removing the `--docker` flag, but you might have to install some dependencies of the build process. These tests take roughly 20 minutes on our build server.

To work with the qemu kmod tests you'll first need to download the base Ubuntu image we use for testing:

```
% wget -P kmod 'https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/focal/current/focal-server-cloudimg-amd64.img'
```

Then you can run the CI tests in kmod like so:

```
% ./ci.py --kmod --short --prepare-image=kmod/focal-server-cloudimg-amd64.img --leader-only
```

The tests redirect dmesg output to `kmod/dmesg`, event tracing output to `kmod/trace`, and the full test log to `kmod/test-out`.

You can also ssh into the qemu which is running the tests with

```
% ssh -p 2223 -i kmod/image-key fmazzol@localhost
```

Note that the kmod tests are very long (~1hr). Usually when developing the kernel module it's best to use `./kmod/restartsession.sh` to be dropped into qemu, and then run specific tests using `terntests`.

However when merging code modifying TernFS internals it's very important for the kmod tests to pass as well as the normal integration tests. This is due to the fact that the qemu environment is generally very different from the non-qemu env, which means that sometimes it'll surface issues that the non-qemu environment won't.

## Playing with a local TernFS instance

```
% ./build.sh alpine
% ./build/alpine/ternrun -binaries-dir build/alpine -data-dir /tmp/tern-test
```

The above will run all the processes needed to run TernFS. This includes:

* 256 metadata shards;
* 1 cross directory coordinator (CDC)
* A bunch of block services (this is tunable with the `-flash-block-services`, `-hdd-block-services`, and `-failure-domains` flags)
* 1 registry instance
* 1 web instance
* 1 gc process responsible for scrubbing for corrupted blocks / migrating failed block services / collecting deleted empty directories and destructing files

A multitude of directories to persist the whole thing will appear in `<data-dir>`. The filesystem will also be mounted using FUSE under `<data-dir>/fuse/mnt`.

Inspecting [`ternrun.go`](https://github.com/XTXMarkets/ternfs/blob/main/go/ternrun/ternrun.go) is a decent way to get familiar with the services required to run a TernFS cluster.

## Building the Kernel module

```
% cd kmod
% ./fetchlinux.sh # fetch linux sources
% (cd linux && make oldconfig && make prepare && make -j) # build Linux
% make KDIR=linux -j kmod
```

### Kernel module as dkms .deb package

```
% cd kmod
% make deb-package
```

## VS Code

Most of the codebase is understandable by VS Code/LSP:

* Code in `go/` just works out of the box with the [Go extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go). I (@bitonic) open a separate VS Code window which specifically has the `ternfs/go` directory open, since the Go extension doesn't seem to like working from a subdirectory.
* Code in `cpp/`:
    - Disable existing C++ integrations for VS Code (I don't remember which exact C++ extension caused me trouble -- something by Microsoft itself).
    - Install the [clangd extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd).
    - Generate `compile_commands.json` with
        
        ```
        % cd cpp
        % ./build.py debug
        % cp ./build/debug/compile_commands.json .
        ```
        
        If you change the build process (i.e. if you change CMake files) you'll need to generate and copy `compile_commands.json` again.
* Code in `kmod/`:
    - [Build the module](#building-the-kernel-module).
    - Generate `compile_commands.json` with `./kmod/gen_compile_commands.sh`.
    - New files should work automatically, but if things stop working, just re-bulid and re-generate `compile_commands.json`.

## A note on naming

TernFS was originally called EggsFS internally. This name quickly proved to be very poor due to the phonetic similarity to XFS, another notable filesystem. Therefore the filesystem was renamed to TernFS before open sourcing. However the old name lingers on in certain areas of the system that would have been hard to change, such as metric names.

## Licensing

TernFS is [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html). The default license for TernFS is [GPL-2.0-or-later](LICENSES/GPL-2.0-or-later.txt).

The protocol definitions (`go/msgs/`), protocol generator (`go/bincodegen/`) and client library (`go/client/`, `go/core/`) are licensed under [Apache-2.0](LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt) with the [LLVM-exception](LICENSES/LLVM-exception.txt). This license combination is both permissive (similar to MIT or BSD licenses) as well as compatible with all GPL licenses. We have done this to allow people to build their own proprietary client libraries while ensuring we can also freely incorporate them into the GPL v2 licensed Linux kernel.
